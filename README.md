# Be Brave
## A text-base command line adventure game.

Play as an adventurer on a quest to save the village of the valley. Make your way across the land fighting monsters, learning magic, and wielding powerful weapons. Will you be the hero we need, or will history forget you?

### About the game
This is the first major programming project I worked as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado Boulder. In total, I spent roughly 30 hours designing and coding "Be Brave" during late nights in November and December of 2019. 

This game holds a very special place in my heart. To me, it represents the blend of analytic thought and imagination that sits at the heart of great coding. Working on it helped ignite a passion for programming and convinced me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

### To Play
Requires a gcc compiler with C++11. To change version of C++, modify line 2 of Makefile (the game should work on more current versions - however, I have not confirmed). To play, clone this repository and navigate there. Run `make` followed by `./play` to begin. Once you're all done, to remove the binary files, run `make clean`.
