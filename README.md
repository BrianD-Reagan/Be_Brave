# Be_Brave
## A text-base adventure game for Linux terminal

Play as an adventurer on a quest to save the village of the valley. Make your way across the land fighting monsters, learning magic, and wielding powerful weapons. Will you be the hero we need, or will history forget you.

### About the game
An early project of mine to create a game using object-oriented programming with C++.

To play, clone this repository and run `make` followed by `./play`. Once you're all done, to clean up binary files, run `make clean`.
